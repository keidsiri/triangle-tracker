_Make a web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. Here are the definitions of each possibility_

_* Equilateral: All sides are equal._
_* Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal._
_* Scalene: No sides are equal_
_* NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side._
